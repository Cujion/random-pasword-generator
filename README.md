## Description
* This project is designed to give you a basic understand of how javascript 
works. In this project there are features that include creating variables, 
if/ else if statements, concat functions to create a pool of options for your 
random password generator, and a math.floor which sets the value to the nearest 
whole number and then a math.random which randomly selects out of the pool of 
options you picked to be able to generate a password for you.
